                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>What is our goal? Well MamsMatter aim to support women through the traumatic time of separation within the family. The objective behind this is improve and promote better outcomes for all parties involved and any interventions.
                <br><br>
					We also like to show how misuse and abuse of substances along with other family issues can affect children who are removed from their families for their own protection and 						how this can affect a child emotionally and physically.
				</p>
                <h3>What's the need for MamsMatter?</h3>
                <p>There is a great need for such a service MamsMatter provide as currently once social services get involved there is no support or help for the mother/parents involved. Statistics currently show that in Blaenau Gwent alone during the period of 2013-2014 there were; 
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children in need cases: 525</li>
                    <li>Child protection cases: 70</li>
                    <li>Referral cases: 1,194</li>
                    <li>Assessment cases: 1,104</li>
                    <li>Abuse/Neglect cases: 380</li>
                    <li>Open cases: 665</li>
				</ul>
                <br>
The majority of these cases end with the child/childrenâs removal from the family for their own safety. This practice is known to have a major impact on childrenâs social and mental state. However it is also documented that children have the best outcomes when the parent has good parental input and contact. 
With these facts in place it is very common for the parent already struggling with substance abuse or other issues also have the weight of loss paced on their shoulders as there child is taken away from them thus causing the abuse to spiral further out of control. However with the input of MamsMatter we CAN break the cycle with support to help address and work through their issues, face their faults and grief.

                    <h3>Testimonial - Nikki Lewis</h3>
                    <p>
                    In October 2014 I was in a very dark place, with nowhere to turn. I lost my children due to drug misuse and domestic violence. I tried to end it all by taking my own life but thankfully it never came to that. This is where Mamsmatter came to my rescue and helped me (Still are) with so many things. They made me see it wasnât just everyone out to get me, and helped me realize what my part was. My life has since turned around and I am in a very good place by being able see my children. I am still involved with Mamsmatter and think I always will be, not just for support but for me to help others.

                    <p>
                    Hearing other women share their experiences and feelings help me accept that I am not the only one and helps lift a little of the guilt and shame I feel around the experience.

                     <p>
                     The people at Mamsmatter helped me when social services got involved and had taken my children away, it was a very hard time for me but I found great support from the group at Mamsmatter and I soon learnt and received advice from all the women that were in the same situation as me. Since joining Mamsmatter my life has been changing and Iâm happy to say my son has come home.
